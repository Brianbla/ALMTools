HOL - Parts Unlimited WebSite Continuous Delivery with Visual Studio Online & Release Management Online
====================================================================================
In this lab we have an application called PartsUnlimited. We want to set up
Visual Studio Online to be able continuously deploy to environemtns in our pipeline. 
This means that whenever code is committed and pushed to the master branch, we want 
to ensure that it integrates into our code correctly to get fast feedback. To do so, 
we are going to be setting up a Continuous Integration build (CI) that
will allow us to compile and run unit tests on our code every time a commit is
pushed to Visual Studio Online.

###Pre-requisites:###

-   An active Visual Studio Online account

-   An active Azure subscription
